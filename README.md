* ~~use Pure64 bootloader from returninfinity, because i have better things to do when writing a 64 bit OS~~
* Or not... code and use Oak64 bootloader, because i can.
* use nasm, because.
* ~~use QEMU, because.~~ ~~Nope, Bochs is better :)~~ Use both.
* use newlib, ~~eventually~~ in a far future
* learn from BareMetal-OS
* read OSDev & OSdever
* Use System V ABI (X86-64)
* LP64 Model
* Use ~~BMFS~~, ~~Ext2~~, ~~Fat32~~, BMFS ... FS Stuff is a nightmare
